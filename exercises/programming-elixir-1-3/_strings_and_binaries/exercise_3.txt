Try the following in iex:

iex > ['cat' | 'dog' ]
['cat', 100,111,103]
Why does iex print ’cat’ as a string, but ’dog’ as individual numbers?”

The head is the first element of a list, in the other hand the tail is a list comprised of a head and a tail. An empty array as a tail indicates the end of the list.
